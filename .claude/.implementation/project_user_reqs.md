# Project Charter: SQL Server Development Database Automation

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** DevDB - Automated Development Database Deployment System  
**Project Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Project Manager:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** July 9, 2025  

## Problem Statement

Development teams currently face significant friction when setting up local SQL Server environments for testing and development. The manual process of exporting schemas, setting up databases, and running test scripts is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent across team members. This leads to:

- Lost development time due to environment setup issues
- Inconsistent test environments across developers
- Difficulty reproducing bugs and testing scenarios
- Barriers to new team member onboarding

## Project Objectives

2. **Streamline Testing Workflow**: Provide seamless test execution similar to SQL Server Management Studio experience
3. **Ensure Environment Consistency**: Guarantee identical database structures across all development environments
4. **Reduce Setup Time**: Decrease environment setup time from hours to minutes

### Secondary Objectives
- Improve developer productivity and satisfaction
- Reduce onboarding time for new team members
- Enable rapid prototyping and feature development
- Create foundation for CI/CD pipeline integration

**Acceptance Tests:**
```gherkin
Given I have the project repository cloned
When I run "./deploy-dev-db.sh"
Then the database should be deployed within 2 minutes
And the database should contain all production tables
And the database should contain all production stored procedures
And the database should contain all production views and functions
And I should receive a success message with connection details
```

#### User Story 1.2: Database Reset
**As a** developer  
**I want to** reset my database to a clean state  
**So that** I can start fresh testing without manual cleanup  

**Acceptance Tests:**
```gherkin
Given I have a database with test data
When I run "./deploy-dev-db.sh"
Then the existing database should be replaced
And all previous test data should be removed
And the database should be in a clean, initial state
```

### Epic 2: Test Execution

#### User Story 2.1: Individual Test Execution
**As a** database developer  
**I want to** run a specific test file  
**So that** I can validate my database changes quickly  

**Acceptance Tests:**
```gherkin
Given I have a test file "test-users.sql"
When I run "./run-test.sh test-users.sql"
Then the test should execute against the database
And I should see clear success/failure output
And the test should complete within 30 seconds
```

#### User Story 2.2: Batch Test Execution
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want to** run all database tests  
**So that** I can validate the entire database functionality  

**Acceptance Tests:**
```gherkin
Given I have multiple test files in the test-scripts directory
When I run "./run-test.sh"
Then all test files should execute in sequence
And I should see progress for each test
And I should get a summary of passed/failed tests
And the process should stop on first failure (optional mode)
```

#### User Story 2.3: Ad-hoc Query Execution
